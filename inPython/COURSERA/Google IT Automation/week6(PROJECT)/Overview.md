# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

We need to process a list of event objects using their date, type, machine, and user attributes to generate a report that lists all users currently logged into the machines.

## RESEARCH

To find out which users are currently logged in and when they logged out. If a user logged into a machine and then logged out, they're no longer logged into it. But if they didn't logout yet, they're still logged in.
