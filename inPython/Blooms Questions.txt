68. A group of n kids sitting in a circle, Given number k start counting from one of the kids. The kid who counts the number k goes out of the circle. continue from the next kid until there is only one kid left. find out the last kid.Example : n = 6 and k = 4
1 --- 2 --- 3
| ---------- |
6 --- 5 --- 4Therefore if we start counting from 1 .. kids are out in the following order: 4 then 2 then 1 then 3 then 6 ....the kid no. 5 is the last kid left.Similar to https://leetcode.com/problems/elimination-game/

80. Design a system that gets packets out of order and how will you handle it.

81. https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/
My Solution: For example, if you have a video, and you receive packets in order 0,1,2,5,6,3,7,4, you will have to keep track of the incoming and previous packet. If the incoming packet is not the expected packet, you will need to store it somewhere and wait until the expected packet has arrived. If the expected packet does not arrive until your timeout, you either continue streaming with the next packet or throw an exception based on the importance of having every packet. For example, if it is just a song, it might not make a big difference if a couple of seconds are skipped. I used maps to write the code for my solution.

101. A TV show is "addictive" if the viewers quickly become addicted to the show and eventually finish watching the show. It can be tracked after viewing how many episodes of a show at least 70% of the viewers who watched that continued on to finish the show entirely. In other words, more that 70% of the viewers who watched the first x eposides of a show continued on to finish the entire show. The x is what we are looking for.Assumptions:All shows have 10 episodesviewers always start from the first episode (no skipping).
